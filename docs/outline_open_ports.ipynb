    "The ``open_ports`` argument opens holes in the outlined geometry at each Port location. If not False, holes will be cut in the outline such that the Ports are not covered. If True, the holes will have the same width as the Ports. If a float, the holes will be widened by that value. If a float equal to the outline ``distance``, the outline will be flush with the port (useful positive-tone processes).\n"
